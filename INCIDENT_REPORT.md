# üö® CRITICAL DATA LOSS INCIDENT REPORT

## **INCIDENT SUMMARY**

- **Date:** September 29, 2025
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Complete data loss
- **Affected Data:** 3 months of financial records (invoices, expenses, income)
- **Root Cause:** Data overwrite with empty defaultData
- **Impact:** User lost all business financial history

## **WHAT HAPPENED**

1. User had 3 months of financial data (invoices, expenses, income)
2. System overwrote real data with empty `defaultData` structure
3. All financial records lost (invoices: 0, expenses: 0, income: 0)
4. Only 1 fixed expense record remained

## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The `loadData()` function in `lib/storage.ts` likely returned `defaultData` instead of user's actual data, causing the `saveData()` function to overwrite real data with empty arrays.

**Problematic Code Pattern:**

```typescript
// This is what likely happened - WRONG
const loadData = async () => {
  // If Supabase fails or returns empty, it falls back to defaultData
  return defaultData; // This overwrites user's real data
};
```

## **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN**

1. ‚úÖ Created emergency recovery page (`/recover`)
2. ‚úÖ Implemented data protection rules
3. ‚úÖ Added safeguards to prevent future overwrites
4. ‚ùå **User's data could not be fully recovered**

## **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **NEVER** assume data doesn't exist
2. **ALWAYS** check multiple data sources before overwriting
3. **ALWAYS** implement data versioning and backups
4. **ALWAYS** preserve existing data when making changes

## **PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED**

1. Data protection rules document created
2. Code review checklist for data operations
3. Emergency recovery mechanisms
4. Data validation before save operations

## **APOLOGY**

This incident represents a complete failure in data protection. The user trusted the system with 3 months of critical business data, and that trust was violated. This is unacceptable and must never happen again.

## **COMMITMENT**

- ‚úÖ Data protection rules are now in place
- ‚úÖ Recovery mechanisms implemented
- ‚úÖ Safeguards added to prevent overwrites
- ‚úÖ **NEVER ALLOW DATA LOSS AGAIN**

---

**This incident serves as a permanent reminder to ALWAYS protect user data.**
